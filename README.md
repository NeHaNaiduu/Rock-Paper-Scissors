# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Description:

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to play against the computer in a browser-based environment. The user can select their move (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking on corresponding buttons, and the computer's move is randomly generated. The winner is determined based on the rules of the game: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. The game interface features dynamic elements to display user and computer choices, as well as the outcome of each round. Additionally, there is an option to reset the score for another round of play.

Features:

Simple and intuitive user interface built with HTML and styled with CSS.

Interactive gameplay using JavaScript for user input and computer-generated moves.

Randomized computer selection for unpredictability and fairness.

Real-time display of user and computer choices, as well as the game outcome.

Usage:

Click on the buttons corresponding to your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) to make your move. The computer's move will be automatically generated, and the outcome of the round will be displayed on the screen.
